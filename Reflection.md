# Reflection for each assignment and project
## Assignment 1
From these assignments, I gained valuable insights into industry expectations and the skills needed to transition from university to a successful career. Through the PETRONAS Digital YGP assignment, I learned about the importance of technical skills like coding and data analysis, along with adaptability and problem-solving, while the industry talk emphasized the need for leadership, strategic job preparation, and soft skills. Both tasks highlighted the significance of teamwork, personal growth, and real-world applications of academic knowledge. Overall, I am inspired to apply these lessons by improving my technical and interpersonal skills, staying adaptable, and continuously striving to meet industry standards in the ICT field.
## Assignment 2
I learned a lot about UTMDigital's organizational structure and how workers work together during this industry visit. These people have made a lot of different services and apps to help college students learn better. We were able to talk to programmer Mr. Adib Aqil, who told us about his thoughts on the workplace and the most important skills for a job in IT. After this visit, I learned more about how IT jobs work and was motivated to study computer science so I can make other people's lives easier and more comfortable.
## Assignment 3
I gained a deeper understanding of the skills required to transition successfully from university to the industry. The speakers emphasized the importance of technical skills like debugging, database management, and logical thinking, as well as the need for soft skills, adaptability, and strategic job preparation using methods like the IRPA framework. Their experiences highlighted the value of perseverance, proactive learning, and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn to secure opportunities. Overall, I am motivated to apply these insights by improving my technical expertise, enhancing my soft skills, and preparing effectively to meet the demands of the ICT industry.
## Project Design Thinking
Through these design thinking assignments, I gained valuable insights into solving real-world problems by focusing on user needs and iterative solutions. The project, InsightAI, allowed me to apply the five stages of design thinking: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Conducting interviews during the empathy phase helped me understand the challenges businesses face with data management, while the define phase honed my ability to articulate problems clearly. Brainstorming in the ideate stage fostered creativity, and developing a functional prototype showcased the importance of teamwork and technical application. Feedback during the testing phase emphasized the value of continuous improvement. Overall, this experience enhanced my problem-solving, collaboration, and innovation skills, motivating me to apply these lessons in future endeavors to create impactful solutions in the ICT field.
